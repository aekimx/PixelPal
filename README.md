### Set up a WebSocket server that listens for incoming WebSocket connections from your Discord clients and handles incoming messages.

### Authenticate your clients with your WebSocket server using tokens or other authentication mechanisms, and establish a WebSocket connection with your server.

### Create a suitable data model for your Discord clone, including objects such as users, channels, messages, and roles.

### Create suitable business logic for your Discord clone, including operations such as sending and receiving messages, creating channels, managing users and roles, and handling events such as voice calls and presence updates.

### Handle incoming WebSocket messages from your clients, and use your application logic to perform the appropriate operations on your data model.

### Send WebSocket messages to your clients to update their views and notify them of new events or changes in the system.

### Handle errors and other exceptions that may occur during the WebSocket connection or application logic, such as validation errors, authentication failures, or network errors.

### Monitor and optimize your WebSocket server and application performance to ensure that it can handle large numbers of concurrent connections and messages.
